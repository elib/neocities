      <h2>Instructions for Windows</h2>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, the WebDAV that comes with Windows file manager has issues with SSL,
        and the problem has not yet been fixed. We recommend using a client like <a href="https://cyberduck.io">Cyberduck</a> with Windows, which is free and has
        WebDAV support. You can also try <a href="https://mountainduck.io/">Mountain Duck</a>
        which will allow you to mount your Neocities site as a hard drive on your computer.

      <h2>Instructions for OSX</h2>

      <p>
        <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/mac-help/connect-to-a-webdav-server-mchlp1546/mac">Use these instructions</a>, and use this URL to connect: <strong>https://neocities.org/webdav</strong>
        <br>
        Enter login info when requested. If you have multiple sites, use the site name as your user name.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also try out <a href="https://cyberduck.io">Cyberduck</a> or <a href="https://mountainduck.io/">Mountain Duck</a> if you run into any issues.
